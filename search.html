                    <div class="blog-1">In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules to
                        convert
                        information—such as a
                        letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for
                        communication
                        through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium. An early example is the
                        invention of
                        language, which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw, heard
                        or felt to
                        others. But speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry, and
                        limits the
                        audience to those present when the speech is uttered . The invention of writing, which converted
                        spoken
                        language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication across space and time. The
                        process of
                        encoding converts information from a source into symbols for communication or storage. Decoding
                        is the
                        reverse process, converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient understands, such
                        as English
                        or/and Spanish. One reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain
                        language,
                        spoken or written, is difficult or impossible. For example, semaphore, where the configuration
                        of flags held
                        by a signaler or the arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message, typically
                        individual letters
                        and numbers. Another person standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce
                        the words
