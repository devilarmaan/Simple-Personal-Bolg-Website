        <p class="blog-1">In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules to convert
            information—such as a
            letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for communication
            through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium. An early example is the invention of
            language, which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw, heard or felt to
            others. But speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry, and limits the
            audience to those present when the speech is uttered . The invention of writing, which converted spoken
            language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication across space and time. The process of
            encoding converts information from a source into symbols for communication or storage. Decoding is the
            reverse process, converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient understands, such as English
            or/and Spanish. One reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain language,
            spoken or written, is difficult or impossible. For example, semaphore, where the configuration of flags held
            by a signaler or the arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message, typically individual letters
            and numbers. Another person standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words
            sent.
